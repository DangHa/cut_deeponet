  <h1> (NeurIPS'26) Smooth Piecewise Cutting for Neural Operator to Handle Discontinuities and Sharp Transitions </h1>
</div>

This repository is the official implementation of [Smooth Piecewise Cutting for Neural Operator to Handle Discontinuities and Sharp Transitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.19823) by Ha Dang, Sebastian Schmidt and Jürgen Hesser.

## Proposed Method

**Idea:** We propose a two-stage training framework that augments neural operators to focus on learning the smooth components while ignoring discontinuities and sharp transitions.

![Method](figures/overview_method.png)

The continuous representations used by neural operators can struggle to accurately approximate output functions that contain discontinuities. Rather than attempting to directly capture these discontinuities through high-frequency features, our key idea is to represent a discontinuous solution as a combination of several smooth components. The network only needs to learn the smooth components while ignoring the discontinuities. Therefore, we reformulate the problem so that the neural operator ignores them during training and focuses on the smooth regions. Because the transformed problem is smooth, the model can be trained more easily using lower-resolution data.

## Directory Structure

Each folder represents a problem demonstrated in the paper, with the following structure:

```text
inviscid_burgers/
├── checkpoints/
├── data/
├── 1_Evaluation_with_TestSet.ipynb
├── DeepONet.ipynb
├── flexDeepONet.ipynb
├── HyperDeepONet.ipynb
├── FNO.ipynb
├── Cut_DeepONet.ipynb
└── CuttingNet.ipynb
```

Note: The `inviscid_burgers`, `linear_advection`, and `parsimonious_model` folders contain experiments comparing the performance of Cut-DeepONet to other methods. They have the same structure.

## Installation & Use Guide

### Setting up
- Install the requirements, run: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
- Create `checkpoints` folder

### Dataset & Pre-trained models
- You can create your own dataset using the files in the `data` folder, or you can download the dataset from the link below and copy it into the `data` folder.
- To save training time, you can download the pretrained models here. These models were trained using the included dataset; copy them into your `checkpoints` folder.

Note: [Dataset and Pretrained Models](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pVaBeqivcpe4wEYlQbGx9cPzBmBUcnLX/view?usp=sharing) is the link to download the dataset and pretrained models.

### Training 

To retrain the models presented in the paper, run all cells in the corresponding training notebooks for each model: `DeepONet.ipynb`, `flexDeepONet.ipynb`, `HyperDeepONet.ipynb`, `FNO.ipynb`, and `Cut_DeepONet.ipynb` (`Cut_DeepONet.ipynb` requires training `CuttingNet.ipynb` first).

### Evaluation

If you already have the checkpoints, or if you download the pretrained models from the link below, you can run `1_Evaluation_with_TestSet.ipynb`. You can replace the test dataset at the beginning of the notebook. At the end of the evaluation, a plot comparing all methods will be generated
